[b]10. Academy and Youth Players[/b]

The academy is another decisive factor of the game. With an academy, you can promote youth players to your team and obtain your future stars! Here is an explanation of all of the aspects regarding the youth academy, and promoting players.

[b]Academy Quality[/b]
When you first start, the academy is non-existent (you'll have to build one). After that, the youth academy can have one of six quality levels. They are:
- Bad Academy
- Passable Academy
- Good Academy
- Very Good Academy
- Excellent Academy
- World-Class Academy
The quality of the academy is not directly related with the quality (skills) of the players that are promoted; however, the quality of your academy affects the progression (potential) of the player. The better your academy is, the better chance you have of promoting players with higher progression (potential). On the other hand, lower quality academies will generate lower progression players.

[b]Quality upgrades/downgrades[/b]
As we said above, initially you'll start with no academy at all. You will have no possible way to promote players until you upgrade your academy to Bad Quality. Raising the quality level of your academy is done step by step. This means that you cannot go from a low level to a high one in one jump. Furthermore, you can only make three upgrades per season, but you are allowed to downgrade as many times as you want.

[b]Maximum number of promoted players[/b]
You cannot promote as many players as you want. There is a limit of 10 promotions per season. There's no limit of promotions per week though – you can (and should, to maximize the training) promote all 10 players just after a season starts (i.e. during PM's two week pre-season).

[b]Player promotion costs[/b]
For each player you promote, it will cost you a certain amount depending on your academy's quality. Naturally, the higher the academy's quality, the higher the cost to promote. The prices are as follows:
- Bad Academy: €2000 pp (per player).
- Passable Academy: €4000 pp.
- Good Academy: €7000 pp.
- Very good Academy: €10000 pp.
- Excellent Academy: €12000 pp.
- World Class Academy: €15000 pp.

[b]Promoted players' attributes[/b]
Players that are promoted from the academy will, in general, have pretty low attributes. No player will have a value above 10 (on a 0-20 scale). The only exceptions will be the physical attributes (speed and strength), which can be a maximum of 12 even if you don't have a specialty built on your academy. Personality attributes do not suffer any kind of limitations. Regarding the age, players will be 17-19 years old.

[b]Player positions/sides[/b]
The position and side of promoted players will be totally random. Since their skills are pretty low, you can change their positions later through proper training. However, sides (right, left, center) will remain the same for the duration of a players' career.

[b]Specialties[/b]
Specialties are an add-on to academies, and they can be set as one of the twelve attributes of the players. Specialties will remove the limits on attributes that you have in academies without a specialty. For example, with a finishing specialty, it is possible for a player to come out with a 20 on that attribute. With a specialty you will also have a minimum value for the specialty attribute - 10. The only disadvantage with specialties (besides the maintenance costs) is that all of your player's other attributes will be limited to 8 (instead of 10), except for the physical attributes (a limit of 12).
You can only have one specialty at a time, and you can only make one specialty upgrade per season.

[b]Maintenance Costs[/b]
There is a weekly cost for having an academy and another extra cost for having a specialty. You can't have a specialty without having an academy. The maintenance costs are as follows:
- Bad Academy: €5000
- Passable Academy: €7500
- Good Academy: €10000
- Very good Academy: €15000
- Excellent Academy: €20000
- World Class Academy: €30000
- Specialty: + €60000 (added to the academy costs)
