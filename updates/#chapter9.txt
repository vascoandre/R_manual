[b]9. The Squad & 2nd/3rd Teams[/b]

As the manager of the team, you'll start with a squad of 22 players. Your squad is divided into three parts: the A Team (Main Squad), the B Team and the Youth Team. Only the main squad will be able to schedule and play matches.

[b]Size Restrictions[/b]
You cannot have more than 50 players on your squad (A + B + Youth Team). At the same time, a team cannot have less than 11 players. However, there might be special circumstances that will make a team have less than 11 players. In this case, there is a special feature that will allow manager to promote a local player – local players will have no progression at all, very low skills and a set contract of €50 per week. They should only be used once you don't have the minimum number of players to play a match. Your board won't allow you to promote local players if there are more than 15 players in the squad. Also, you must have at least 7 players on the pitch in order to play a match. Any less than 7, and you will suffer a walk over (an automatic loss – no training occurs when a walk over occurs).

[b]Main (A) Team[/b]
You can have as many players as you want in your main squad... as long as it doesn't breach the maximum squad size of 50 players.

[b]Reserve (B) Team[/b]
You cannot have more than 16 players on your B team and they will be available to play in your main team matches. There isn't an age restriction for players in this team, but keep in mind that players over 22 years old won't receive any kind of positive training while they are in this team (and they can also become unhappy if they remain in the B team for too long.
B team trainings occur at the same time as league trainings, so there are 2 trainings per week. B team players won't train after friendly or cup matches unless they play a minimum of 30 minutes in those matches.
As said before, the B team does not participate in any kind of matches on its own.

[b]Youth Team[/b]
Here are the rules:
- A youth player is no older than 18 years of age (17 or 18 year old players only). After they reach 19 they are moved to the main squad automatically.
- Players with 17 or 18 years old can be sent to the Youth Team. You will be able to call them up to play games and send them back to full training when you don’t need them in the squad.
- You can have as many players as you want in the youth squad.
- A youth player cannot participate in any matches at all – no exceptions. He does not have a fixed position, although you'll have access to what his position would be if he was a regular player (on the A or B team).
- A youth player cannot be sold or bought through the Bosman Rule.
- The training received by a youth player is the same as normal league trainings (full training at 100%). However, remember that youth players do not train during friendly or cup matches – only league matches.

For more accurate information on training you should take a look at Section 8.

[center][b]Controlling a secondary team[/b][/center]

[b]You can control more than one team in PManager. Having secondary teams is just like managing another team. You can do all the things you can do with your first (and main) team as main and secondary teams are not linked.[/b]

[u]There are some restrictions in this feature though[/u]:
- You can’t transfer players between two clubs you control
- You can’t pass players between any of your teams
- You can only have 1 team in the same series of a country:
 > if we’re talking about the 1st division in the same country, only one team can stay, others will be relegated;
 > if we’re talking about a secondary division, team(s) will be spread over the existing series;
 > users can set priorities (check "My Clubs" page, under the manager menu), so that they can control which teams are relegated in case the system finds two (or more) of your teams in the same series and country.
- Just like what happens with your main team, it is FORBIDDEN to set a weak team on the pitch to help one of your teams, another team or to obstruct another team.
- When you pick a secondary team, you need to respect the Federation rules of the country you’re picking your team from, most specifically the "Foreign Managers" rule.
- Manager ranking/reputation points are not awarded for your secondary teams.
- You can’t apply to other teams in your second team. That option is only available for your main club.

[u]Some other details[/u]:
- You can control at once as many teams as you want (one of those being your main team). You can pick a teams freely from the list of available teams!
- It’s important to know that you’ll inherit the full team details once you pick it. No reset is applied to the team’s details once you pick a secondary team. There is only one exception: teams with negative balance are reset to 250k euros.
- You can have a shortlist of 250 players for each club you “own”.
- If you subscribe to PM Fan, you’ll have PM Fan on all teams you control.

[b]In order to get secondary teams you need to spend PM Coins! The anual cost of your 3rd and next teams is the same, and greater than the cost of your first secondary team. PM Fans will have a discount when you purchase this service.[/b]

To switch between your clubs, just go to the Manager’s menu (the menu that has your nickname) and pick the “My Clubs” option. Clubs are managed individually.
