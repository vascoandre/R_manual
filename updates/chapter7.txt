[b]7. Players[/b]

Every player has some personal details that you should be aware of:

[u]Experience[/u]: This is a very important characteristic of the player that is only used for calculations during matches. The more experienced a player is, the better he will play. Experience levels range from "Terrible" to "World Class". Participating matches raise a player’s experience. The matches that add more experience to the players are National Team matches, followed by International competitions matches. After that, we have league, cup, regular phases of international competition and finally (the least experience-profitable) friendly matches;

[u]Temperament[/u]: The higher a player's temperament, the higher the possibility for a player to be shown cards during a match. Temperament ranges from "Super Passive" to "Exaggerated". This characteristic does not change with time;

[u]Professionalism[/u]: This characteristic influences three things: the first is that a player with high professionalism will be a good team captain; the second is that a squad with low levels of professionalism will usually not be eager to receive lectures; the third, probably the most important, it influences skill loss on older players. This characteristic is also unchanged until the player retires;

[u]Form[/u]: Form has a lot of influence on player’s performance during matches. The higher his form, the better his performance will be. It's a good idea to avoid fielding players with low form because the team's general performance will probably suffer quite a lot. Form can change after matches and there are two situations in which these changes can happen. First, if the player played in any match then his form will have a 50% chance of rising, a 25% chance of staying the same and a 25% chance of decreasing. Secondly, if a player didn't play in the match then his form will have as many chances to rise, remain the same or decrease. When player's form is at Very Good (the highest form can be) then there is a 66% chance for it to change / 33% chance for it to remain the same - regardless of playing or not.

[u]Injury Proneness[/u]: this is a hidden “skill” that makes a player more prone to injuries. Observe your players for a while to see if they get injured often; if they do then it is likely that their injury proneness is high. This skill also remains the same during a player's entire career.

[u]Fitness[/u]: fitness is shown as a description (only the player's owner and manager of the National Team with a confirmed squad have access to the numeric value). Fitness has a lot of influence during matches, but it is not a decisive factor in case fitness is between Fit & Completely Fit. Players below this level will probably start to seriously compromise the team's performance. Carefully manage your squad’s fitness to avoid unnecessary injuries and/or training penalties. The best players to field are players who are Fit or Completely Fit. Also keep in mind that fitness has influence on training. Please check Section 8 in this manual to view specific information concerning fitness’ affect on training.
Here's the numeric/alpha-numerical relation for fitness: From 0% to 20%: Drained ; From 21% to 49%: Very Tired ; From 50% to 79%: Tired ; From 80% to 90%: Fit ; 91% to 100%: Completely Fit.

Players only lose fitness in two situations: playing matches and getting injured. Injuries affect both fitness and the health of the player.

About fitness losses during matches:
- Players will lose more or less fitness depending on their age. There are three "levels" of player’s ages: 17 to 23 years old (included); 24 to 30 (included); and 31 and above. The older a player is then the more fitness that player will lose. The difference from one level to the next is not very large. You can easily observe the differences in loss from direct observation.
- Players lose more fitness in League, Cup and International (National Teams) matches. Less fitness is lost if a team plays with PIC (Play It Cool). Players lose the least fitness in Friendly matches. Tournament and International Team Competitions do not cause fitness losses at all.
- Players that start the match with 100% fitness will lose 1% less fitness than if they would have started the match with less than 100% fitness. This is true for all matches in which fitness loss is able to occur.
- A player that is brought in as a substitute will lose less fitness than a player who starts the match.
- Playing with MOTS (Match of the Season - more information in Section 13 of this manual) will make all players lose more fitness than normal. Once again, you can easily know the correct difference in values from direct observation.
Regarding training, you should know that fitness training sessions occur after league matches and increase fitness by 15%. In cup/friendly games the increase is only 10%. For matches:
- Playing with PIC (Play it Cool - More information in Section 13 of this manual) will reduce all player’s fitness loss during a match.
- Remember those three levels of player ages we told you about (above)? The same applies for fitness recovery if a player does not play in a league match (and only in league matches!). Older players recover less fitness than younger players: 12% for 17 to 23 years old, 10% for 24 to 30 years old and 8% for 31 years old and above. 
- In case a player’s individual training has not been selected then they will automatically receive a small fitness bonus (1%). Remember to keep an eye on your individual training, especially if you are training youth or have recently purchased a player off of the TL, Free Transfer or through the Bosman Rule. The bonus will be 2% in case we are talking about a player that is 31 years old or older.

[u]Health[/u]: Health is a level from 0 to 100%, just like fitness. It will influence, amongst other things, a player’s chance to be injured during a match. Here's how it works:
- If a player is not injured, a low fitness level will make the health level slowly drop.
- A low health level will make your player more prone to injuries during a match. The hidden injury proneness skill will be taken into consideration along with the low health level. It will just add to the injury proneness indicator.
- When a player gets injured, his health level will drop according to the severity of his injury. This will determine the amount of time (number of days) a player will be injured. When he gets to 90% health, he is considered "cured" and his injury will disappear.
- According to the player’s health level, he will lose some fitness on a daily basis while he is injured. The lower his health level, the more fitness he will lose. So, players recovering from long injuries will return at a lower fitness level than players who were only injured for a day or two. They will probably need some fitness training in order to avoid another quick injury and/or training penalty due to their low fitness. You are also able to hire a Physio to speed up the healing process of your injured players. You can learn more about the Physio under Section 16 in the Help Manual.

For more information about the fitness scale, please refer to Section 34 for all Denominations.

[b]Player’s Skills[/b]
Player’s skills are numeric levels that range from 0 to 20. With training, players can slowly progress in each of the individual skills. However, the actual amount of progression per training depends on the actual player's potential. Read more about that under Section 8. Player’s skills are always shown rounded, without any decimal points. However, skills will always have a decimal value. (e.g. 12.34 will always be shown as 12). This means that when you see a player with, let's say, 18 in finishing, the player might actually have 17.5, 18.49, or any other value in between. The Match Engine will use decimals in its calculations, so a player with a high 18 in Finishing (e.g. 18.4) will perform better than a player with a low 18 in Finishing (ex 17.6).

[b]When do players decide to retire?[/b]
At the age of 30, players can decide to retire from football. You'll get a warning on the player's profile page in case he decides to retire. These kinds of decisions are always made during season changes so you'll always have at least one full season to prepare in case a certain player decides to “hang-up the old boots”. Professionalism and injury proneness will play an important role in his decision to retire. However, if a player is 30 and plays quite a bit (or has pretty good skills) then he will most likely not announce his retirement at the age of 30.

[b]How do players become unhappy?[/b]
Players might become unhappy for several reasons: being in the B/Reserve Squad; not being part of the Starting Eleven; not enough playing time, etc. Happiness can have two side effects: unhappy players won't renew their contracts and they will play a little bit worse in matches. Although the latter is very minor.

Happiness will influence the player's performance during matches, and it will also affect whether he wants to renew his contract or not. It will be shown as a percentage level on the players’ information screen.
A series of factors will affect your players’ happiness level. It might drop if:
- the player has better skill than the average of the team and is playing less than 50% of the minutes;
- the player wants a better wage;
- the player is older than 23 and is currently on the reserves;
- the player has better skill than the average of the team and is currently on the Reserves;
- the player is older than 23 and is playing less than 25% of the minutes;
- the player is currently playing on the wrong position (two times in a row);
- the player is currently on the transfer list;
- the player is currently playing with low fitness (more than two times in a row).

If, however, all of these conditions are met your player’s happiness will rise 5% per day. If they’re not met, in the worst case scenario, it will drop by 5% per day.
You can balance negative factors with the following "bonus conditions":
- the player is playing on more than 90% of the season minutes;
- the player is earning 25% more than his desired wage
(minutes = league_minutes + cup_minutes)

You will have access to a page detailing whether a certain condition has been met or not. As said, the happiness will affect a player’s performance directly during matches. It will be a multiplier on his skill during a match, but not a direct multiplier (a 0% happy player will not play at 0% of his skills!). Let’s say that the lower the happiness the worse the player will play; however, there’s a lower limit to the negative effect low happiness can have. A happy player will play at 100% of his skills.

[b]How do player contracts work?[/b]
Players have to sign contracts in order to be allowed to play for a team. A contract consists of two things: a set duration in seasons and a weekly wage.

The maximum duration of a contract is 5 game years/seasons. The maximum wage is determined by the wage roof of your club.

Once a player has reached the last season on his contract, he will only renew with a team if he has played a certain number of minutes. The better the player is, the higher the number of minutes he will require. The maximum number of minutes they'll ask for is 630 minutes (7 full matches). Only league and cup matches are used for these calculations.

After the 12th round of the league, all players with 1 year left on their contract will be eligible to sign a contract with another club under the Bosman Rule. Once a player gets an offer from another club you'll be able to submit a counter-offer before he makes his decision. More information on deadlines can be found under Section 11. However, he'll ask for a wage higher than usual if you've waited until the last minute to renegotiate a contract with him.

The factors of the formula to determine both player wages and contract duration are:
- The club’s reputation has a somewhat bigger weight on the wage the player asks for.
- Players in their peak age (roughly 26 years old) will ask for higher wages than younger or older players.
- Players will now ask for more sensible contract durations. Club reputation, age and skill will be major factors in this particular area. It is now also possible that they do not accept to renew for added years, but only review their current wage. The old "refresh" cheat was also removed (players will always ask for the same contract duration, it will not change with every time the page is refreshed).
- Older players will gradually ask for shorter durations in contract renewals.
- Player happiness will play an important role in the player’s decision to renew his contract. Players with low happiness will most likely reject contract renewals, except if they think their current wage is too low (and in case it is affecting their happiness). In that case the player will accept a new contract, but not added years to it.

To sum it up, it is likely players will ask for higher wages than before, and since duration is also more sensibly calculated, it will be something managers will have to be extra careful from now on. Maintaining great players will be harder for smaller teams (at least maintaining them with long duration contracts) and costlier for bigger teams.

[b]What do Favorite and First Club mean, and how are they relevant?[/b]
The First Club of a player is pretty easy to understand: it's the club where the player started his career - whether he was promoted from the team's academy or because he was part of the original roster (when you received the team right after you joined). The Favorite Club of a player is a little different. Favorite Club is where he played most of his official matches during his career (to date).

This is quite important as these teams will receive tax benefits from future transfers of the player, even if the player is no longer part of their clubs. For more information on transfer taxes please refer to Section 11.

[b]How do I transfer list a player?[/b]
There are two ways to transfer a player: by going to Team >> Transfers >> Sell Players or by selecting a player on your squad and then selecting Sell Options on that player's profile menu (right side menu).

For more information about transfers and the transfer market, view Section 11.

[b]How do I dismiss/sack a player?[/b]
By going to his profile page and selecting the "Release" option. You will have to pay the player 2 full weeks of wages in order to release him. Make no mistakes here: there is no going back once you release a player. Avoid toying around with this feature! Sacked players will not be “brought back to life” if you sack a player on accident.

NOTE: You cannot sack players who have been capped at least once by their country's U21 or National Team's. This rule serves to prevent highly rated players from being dismissed by mistake (or even on purpose - as sabotage). If you still desire to get the player off of your team – try selling him for the minimum price.

Next, we will analyze player skills. Skills are divided into two parts: Technical and Physical. Both types of skills are numeric levels that range from 0 (minimum) to 20 (maximum).

- Handling: How good a player is at handling the ball. Valid for goalkeepers only;
- Crosses: How good the player is at catching balls from crosses. Valid for goalkeepers only;
- Reflexes: How good the player is at making reflex saves. Valid only for goalkeepers;
- Agility: How agile the player is. Valid for goalkeepers only;
- Tackling: How good the player is at tackling his opponents.
- Heading: How good the player is at heading the ball. This includes his jumping ability;
- Passing: How accurately the player can pass the ball. Includes both short and long passes;
- Positioning: How good the player is at keeping a good position on field;
- Finishing: How good the player is at scoring when given an opportunity;
- Technique: How good the player's technique and ball control are. Includes dribbling;
- Speed: How fast the player can run when at top speed.
- Strength: How physically strong the player is.

Since we've explained all of the attributes, the next step is going to explain what attributes are the most important skills for each position..
There are 3 categories for each position: main attributes (primary), secondary attributes and physical attributes. Physical attributes have the same importance for all players, and hence all categories; they are strength and speed. This means that the percentage physical attributes influence the player's overall skill is the same for goalkeepers, defenders, midfielders and forwards. The other two categories work like this: the main attributes (primaries) have a higher percentage of influence on the player's overall skill and should be used as the main reference when comparing players of the same position. The secondary attributes should be used for comparison purposes if players are similar in their main attributes (if they are equal in main and secondary attributes, you should check the physical attributes instead). All of the other attributes (the tertiary attributes) also have some relevance to the player's overall skill; however, they are minor in comparison to main, secondary and physicals.
Next we will tell you the relation between skills and positions:

[b]Goalkeeper[/b]
[u]Main Attributes[/u]: Handling, Crosses
[u]Secondary Attributes[/u]: Reflexes, Agility

[b]Defender[/b]
[u]Main Attributes[/u]: Tackling, Heading
[u]Secondary Attributes[/u]: Passing, Positioning

[b]Midfielder[/b]
[u]Main Attributes[/u]: Passing, Positioning
[u]Secondary Attributes[/u]: Tackling, Technique

[b]Forward[/b]
[u]Main Attributes[/u]: Finishing, Technique
[u]Secondary Attributes[/u]: Heading, Positioning

[u]Physical Skills[/u]: Speed, Strength

The actual side of the player (left, right, center) does not interfere with the attributes for each position. For this table, what really matters is if the player is goalkeeper, defender, midfielder or forward. Be aware, that if you play a Center on the Left or Right side - he will receive a small penalty. The same small penalty applies to playing a Left or Right "out of position".

You can only view your own squad’s skills/attributes. The only exceptions are when a player is on the transfer list or if you are the U21 or National Team manager (in this case you'll be able to see the attributes of the players in the U21 and National Squad after you release the squad for the coming match).

The main, secondary and physical skills are shown on the Skills tab on any given player's profile page. All tertiary skills are shown on the Other Skills tab on any given player's profile page.

[b]My player changed his position? Why?[/b]
Each player has an overall skill for each possible position (known as Global Skill). The higher overall skill will define the player's position. When training attributes, overall skills change over time. So it's possible that a player can change positions in case the correct training scheme is applied. For example, you are training a defender on passing. He could possibly become a midfielder if he is continuously trained on midfielder skills rather than defender skills.

Sometimes, when you start with a new team, players have very balanced overall skills for some positions. This makes them change their position in the very first training they have. This is not a big deal as you can change them back to their initial position with a couple of trainings.

There's another common mistake users often make with recently promoted players from their academies. They are pulled with a position that does not match their manager's preference. And the manager just dismisses the player. This is a very big mistake as players coming from academies with low skills have the possibility to change position. There is a mythical example in PM to prove this theory: ADM-aenariel once bought a Belgian goalkeeper. He had very good potential so aenariel just made a long-term training scheme with passing & positioning. A couple seasons later, this player was called to the U21 World Cup to play for his National Team as a... midfielder!

[center][b]The Talents[/b][/center]
Talents will only be available for players promoted in the academies, meaning that all existing players at the time of the release will not be affected by this feature.

[u]Now let’s talk about the feature itself[/u]
- A player can only have one Talent.
- Talents cannot be learned or trained nor can they be lost or turned off.
- Talents will be assigned randomly to players once they are pulled from the academies. As said we have decided not to assign talents to existing players.
- You won’t need to buy anything for your academy so that your players "born" with talents. Statistically, 1 out of each 10 new (academy) players will have talents. This is not a guaranteed number though: you can have more, you can have less.
- Talents will be situation/(advanced) tactic specific. They will only be active when the situation occurs. You’ll understand more when you read the initial list of talents.
- Talents will give bonuses to certain skills and penalizations to the global skill of players (or to skills too, it depends on what talent are we talking about). For example if a player has the "Fast" talent (+2 on speed and -2 on strength) and 20 speed the contribute he will give to this weather AT will be with his 20(+2) skill. Therefore 22.
- As skills, talents are not shown to other managers, unless they are in the transfer list. Scouts cannot find Talents (for now).

[b]Now the initial list of Talents (Name: Pros | Cons) *notes:[/b]
*>> GS means Global Skill
*>> SP means Short Passing
*>> LP means Long Passing
*>> DP means Direct Passing

[b]Tactical Based[/b]
*notes: these talents will only occur if you play with specific AT/Tactic. For example, if you have a player with the "High Pressing Specialist" the bonuses and penalizations will only occur if you use this AT. If you don’t use it, the talent will not be active.
