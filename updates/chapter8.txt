[b]8. Training System[/b]

Training is one of the most important factors in this game. You should always be paying attention to your player’s evolution. Here is an explanation of how training works.

[b]When do training sessions occur?[/b]
Training sessions occur after your club's official matches (League or Cup) and normal friendly matches come to an end. You can know the exact date of your last training session on the top of the training reports page.

[b]How does training works?[/b]
Training is divided into two sections: Staff-training related to team's staff (Manager, Assistant Manager and Coaches..but we'll talk further and in particular in chapter n.16) and individual training. Individual training is the kind of training that each player follows individually.
Individual training overrides staff-training; players always train what you set them to train individually. Staff training will only influence whether the player will train that specific individual training with a bonus between 80% and 100% (it depends by coaches levels: each level > +5% more than 75%).
Players with an individual training other than staff-training will suffer a penalty of 25% on their training regime and so they would only train at 75% of what their natural progression allows.
It's important to mention that due to the fact that individual training overlaps staff-training, players that don't have any orders to train individually will not receive training at all (except for a very small fitness gain).

[b]How does physical-skills training works?[/b]
Physical training works like each other skills training: it depends by player's progression, type of staff/manager-training and staff-quality. Of course, when progression will drop to lower levels, physical skills will grow slower (like each other)

[b]What is a player's Progression?[/b]
The progression is a player characteristic that defines his evolution capacity and if affect ALL SKILLS (physical and technical). The higher his progression, the higher the evolution of the skill that he trains during each training session.
To view a player's progression, you can go to the player's detail page. An alternate way to view progression of a player is to go to your assistant manager's squad analysis. However, you must have an AM of at least level zero (0) to see this page.
Normally, younger players have higher progression values than older players. The progression level remains the same until a player reaches the age of 21. At that age, his progression will suffer a 25% reduction. The reduction will continue until he reaches the lowest progression - Terrible. This doesn't mean that they will drop a full level of progression – progression is not linear; it is a full integer value that cannot be seen by the manager. Each “text” level is, in reality, a range of numeric values - and the 25% drop can drop a player’s progression two full levels, a full level or a no levels at all (although the non-visible numeric value will indeed drop 25% at all times).

[b]How does skill loss works?[/b]
Basically, starting to 28 years, players are subject to skills-losses. There are 2 "groups" to be analysed: "28-32 years" and ">32 years". Let us explain:

[u]28-31 y.o. players[/u]
These players have a chance to receive a negative training at one of ALL skill even if they play and this chance is affected by [b]professionalism skill[/b]. Higher levels of professionalism means that a player will have this % (or chance) reduced. Age is also important, of course. For players with the same professionalism, a 28 years old player has a reduced chance of negative training than a player with 29. The same happens for a 29 years old player comparing with a 30 years old player. This is a clear scheme, in order to understand this system:

- A 28 years old player with 0 professionalism will have a 15% chance of negative training.
- A 28 years old player with 5 professionalism will have a 0% chance of negative training.
- A 32 years old player with 0 professionalism will have a 55% chance of negative training.
- A 32 years old player with 5 professionalism will have a 30% chance of negative training.

The only missing scenario in this age range (28-32) is when a player doesn't play. In this case, a training loss is now guaranteed.

[b]The skill loss for players in this age range is -0.2
This is only valid for league games of course.[/b]

[u]Over 32 y.o. players[/u]
A training loss will occur in every training for this age range, even if a player plays a match. The skill loss can occur in every skill whether the player plays or does not play in a match.

[b]The skill loss for players in this age is: -0.4
As before, this is only valid for league games of course.[/b]

[b]Are trainings equal on every match?[/b]
The answer is no. League matches are more effective: every player will train to their full progression. During cup and friendly matches, there is a penalty of 50% on their progression capacity. Despite this, all of the opportunities to train your players should be fully used. What was mentioned before only applies to national matches between clubs. During National Team’s matches or international club competitions, there is absolutely no training at all.

[b]Do all players train?[/b]
It depends. During league matches, all players that were on the pitch for 30 minutes or more are eligible for training. These players will train at 100% of their natural progression. All others – whether they were on the field for less than 30 minutes or didn’t play at all - will suffer a training penalty, and will not train to their fullest progression.
During cup and friendly matches, the players considered as non-participants – players who didn't play or played less than 30 minutes - will not train at all.

[b]How can I see the trainings?[/b]
The player's evolution can be followed on the Training page or in Office page (homepage after login). In front of the attribute you are training the indication of evolution/regression that the player had on the latest training session is shown, along with the attribute(s) where the change(s) took place.

[b]Is it necessary to have an Assistant Manager or Coach to train?[/b]
The answer is yes...and no. Let us explain: It's not necessary to have either an Assistant Manager or Coach for your players to train. You, as the manager of the team, will be able to train one attribute at global training. Said this, you have to know that Staff member(s) can help your players' training, taking care of other skills up to 100%. More info about these bonus can be found in "Staff" chapter n.16

[b]How does the B/reserve squad training work?[/b]
The B/reserve squad exists for the younger players to evolve until they are good enough (in your opinion) to join the main squad. They receive training even if they do not participate in matches. However, the B/reserve squad trainings are only applied during league matches. So, there will be no training during cup or friendly matches. Even though they train without playing, the B/reserve squad players will not train at their maximum progression. Try to play your most promising youth players as much as possible in order to see a quicker evolution. If any of your B/reserve team players play 30 minutes or more during a league match then (only) those players will train at the normal league match progression level.
Remember that players 22 years old or older who are on the B/reserve squad will suffer a penalty on their training. It's best to promote them to the main squad if they're 22 years old or older, in order to avoid that penalty.

[b]If my players with 27 years old or older do not play, are they subject to two negative trainings?[/b]
Not at all! A player can only have a single negative training.

[b]Fitness & Training[/b]
Fitness has an impact on training. Players that have less than 80% fitness at the time the training occurs will suffer training penalties. The lower the fitness, the higher the penalty will be. Remember, training occurs after the match has been played. So, if your player has 80% fitness before the league match, he will receive the training penalty because after the match he will have less than 80% fitness.

[b]What about training in the youth team?[/b]
The training received by a youth player is the same as a normal league match training (full training).
This kind of training always takes place along with league trainings. Youth players only train during league matches. Therefore, there will be no training for youth team players for cup or friendly matches.

[b]Do International Club Competitions, Tournaments and National Teams matches award any training at all?[/b]
There is no training awarded for any of these matches. The reason behind this is simple: most of the players in PM will not have a chance to play in these types of matches so it would give an extremely unfair advantage to those “special ones”.

[b]My player played the minimum 30 minutes, but he didn't train. Why?[/b]
Well, first check to see if the player has his individual training set. Players have their individual training skill reset once they are transferred to a new team, for example. Another common problem that many users have is when a recently bought player does not train. This might happen because the player already trained for his previous team on the same match day. As you know, games in PM are divided into two days for all countries. For example: the friendly/cup games are played on Mondays and Tuesdays (depending on the country). So, let's imagine that your recently bought player played Monday for his old club, and plays Tuesday (or late in the same day) for your team. If this happens, and if the player trained on Monday, he won't be training again with your team.

[b]What happens when a player is injured during the match? Will he train?[/b]
It depends. The rule is: injured players do not train. However, if he was able to play at least 30 minutes in the match then he will receive full training. Anything less than 30 minutes will not give him the right to train.
